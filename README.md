Learning high-dimensional causal effect.

In this repository, we propose simulation of causal effect and study of deep learning models on the simulated dataset.

This work is inspired by Claudia Shi et. al. https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02120; https://github.com/claudiashi57/dragonnet. We adapted parts of code, and use the same code structure. 

For the Vision Transformer class, we refer code presented here: https://keras.io/examples/vision/image_classification_with_vision_transformer/
